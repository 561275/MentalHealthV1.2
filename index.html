        <h6> What does it effect?</h6>
        <h5>Mental illness refers to a wide range of mental health conditions — disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include
            <br> depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and addictive behaviors.Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a
            <br> mental health concern becomes a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function. A mental illness
            <br> can make you miserable and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with
            <br> a combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).</h5>
